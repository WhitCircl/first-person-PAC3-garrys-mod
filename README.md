# first-person-PAC3-garrys-mod
a PAC3 file that lets you see your body just like real life

to install this mod you will need PAC3
the download link is:
https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=104691717

once PAC3 has finished downloading you will need to move the first person file into the data folder found in the garrys mod folder

to find this folder you would need to: right click on garrys mod in your steam library > manage > browse local files

once you did that go to:
garrysmod > data > pac3

just extract the first person file in there and load up garrys mod

once youve loaded into a map click on PAC3 with the context menu (hold down C) and load first person 

and there you have it you can now see your body as you would in real life

FUN FACT:
since this is made on PAC3 you can customize this however you want.
laser size, color, texture, camera position, dosent matter, you can create your own first person however you want.

also another fun fact you can run this on ANY server that has PAC3 installed and the camera setting enabled

BE AWARE:
there is gonna be some playermodel clipping or camera missalignments but as mentioned in the text above you can customize it however you want.

when you fire your weapon bullets may not go the way your default crosshair is telling them to thats why i implomented a laser.

thats why the default crosshair should be turned off 
to prevent any missunderstanding where the bullets will go.

you are headless! this is used to prevent model clipping

that should be it, and remember...
have fun!!!
